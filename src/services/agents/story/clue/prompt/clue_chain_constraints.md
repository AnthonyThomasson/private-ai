The clue chains should represent unopinionated facts about evidence in the murder.

A clue chain can include multiple clues, some of which may disprove other clues in the chain.

Make sure the clue chains are relevant to the murder details.

Clue chains may introduce new people to the murder investigation.

The clues should NOT discuss the results of interrogation, and instead should mention information that suspects know to be true that could be identified in a interrogation.

The addClueChains tool will either return the reason why the clue chains need to be adjusted, or "success" if the clue chains are valid.

- If the reason is "retry", you should retry the tool call with the adjusted clue chains.
- If the reason is "success", you should stop the tool call.
