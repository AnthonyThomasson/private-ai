Make sure you create the specified number of clue chains.

The clue chains should represent information about the murder, but not include any theories or assumptions about how it relates to the investigation.

Each clue chain provided should not rely on other clue chains.

A clue chain can include multiple clues, some of which may disprove other clues in the chain.

Make sure the clue chains are relevant to the murder details.

Clue chains may introduce new people to the murder investigation.

The clue chains should include people who know information about the murder.

The clues should NOT explicity mention interrogation or investigation.

The addClueChains tool will either return the reason why the clue chains need to be adjusted, or "success" if the clue chains are valid.

- If the reason is "retry", you should retry the tool call with the adjusted clue chains.
- If the reason is "success", you should stop the tool call.
